# LaTeX-Stuff
Some things I use for my LaTeX environment

It is probably of little use to you, as it contains abbrevations and so on that *I* rely on for *my* stuff.
However, feel free to see whether parts of it can be helpful to you ...
Maybe, you might like my coding examples?

Note that most stuff here is taken from some random webpage.
Handle with care ;-)
